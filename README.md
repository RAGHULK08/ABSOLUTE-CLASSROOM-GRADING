Absolute grading thresholds are hardcoded in descending order, making it easy to adjust grade boundaries.

Macro usage (SCAN_NUM, PRINT_NUM[_UNS], etc.) abstracts away many of the low‑level BIOS/DOS I/O details.

Scalability for up to 1000 students; all loops are bounded by the user‑supplied N.

Sorting plus record alignment ensures that IDs stay matched with their marks through the bubble sort.

Comprehensive reporting: academic metrics (average, median), performance distribution, and even min/max details with IDs.
